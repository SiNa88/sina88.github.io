            <p class="small">Apache Edgent is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software
                Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
                until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
                have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
                not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
                project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>

# Apache Edgent website

## Location

http://edgent.incubator.apache.org/

## How it works

This procedure was borrowed in part from the [Apache Apex site](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-apex-site.git) except we use Jekyll.

The `master` branch of this repo contains the source files that are used to generate the HTML that ultimately gets pushed to the incubator site. The `asf-site` branch is where the actual generated files are stored. Note that this branch must contain exactly one folder called `content`, and so has been checked out as an orphan branch with its own commit history apart from the `master` branch. See the *Contributing* section below.

Through a [gitpubsub](http://www.apache.org/dev/gitpubsub.html) mechanism on the apache.org server, files are taken from the `asf-site` branch and pushed to the live server.

## Contributing

If you would like to make a change to the site:

1. Fork the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/apache/incubator-edgent-website)
2. Create a new branch from `master`
3. Add commit(s) to your branch
4. Test your changes locally (see the *Developing* section)
5. Open a pull request in the GitHub mirror
6. A committer will merge your changes if all is good

If you are a committer, do the following:

1. Update the master branch with your (or a Pull Request's) change
2. Push updated master to the [ASF remote master](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-edgent-website.git)
3. Run `build.sh` from the master branch directory (requires Jekyll). This checks out and updates the `asf-site` branch with a new commit of the build from the current branch.
4. At this point, you should be on the `asf-site` branch. Simply push this branch to the asf remote with `git push origin asf-site` and the site will automatically be updated within seconds.

Note: If you want to try out the website locally on the asf-site branch before you push, you can do so with `jekyll serve -d content --skip-initial-build` and point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`.

### Style Guide

The website utilizes [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as the basis for website content. This [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) may prove useful.

In order to ensure a consistent user experience, these guidelines should be followed:

1. For all headers, use sentence-style capitalization
   * Capitalize the first word of the title/header or subtitle/subheader
   * Capitalize any proper nouns and certain other types of words (e.g., programming terms)
   * Use lowercase letters for everything else
2. Page headers should start at Level 2 using `##` in order to have them be automatically added to the Table of Contents
3. Do not skip header levels. For instance, do not jump from `##` to `####`.
4. Use section headings as a way to separate large blocks of content and as reference markers in the Table of Contents
5. Code references (e.g., to a Java class) should be placed in [inline code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) using a single backtick `` ` ``
6. For [code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code), use three backticks `` ``` ``, and if applicable, specify the language for syntax highlighting
7. Avoid using raw HTML tags. Use the equivalent Markdown syntax.
8. Whitespaces
   * Use one whitespace between sentences.
   * Use one blank line between paragraphs for the best readability
   * Do not use leading whitespace, except for special cases, such as indenting within list items
   * Do not use trailing whitespace, except for the case where a line break is needed. In that case, end a line with two spaces.
9. Use correct spelling and grammar, especially for references to other projects. For example, use *GitHub*, not *Github*.

## Developing

1. Make your changes under the `site` directory: `cd site`
2. `jekyll serve`
3. Point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`
